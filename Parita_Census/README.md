### Project Overview

 This is a project on array operations in python.


### Learnings from the project

 Array operations such as slicing and filtering were frequently used in different ways. So, I feel more comfortable using them now.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Reading about the syntaxes online helped a lot as there weren't many illustrated examples.


### Challenges faced

 It was extremely difficult to get some of the operations in slicing and filtering right. It was very taxing to overcome them even after reading different sources on the topic. Practice made solving them a bit easier afterwards.
