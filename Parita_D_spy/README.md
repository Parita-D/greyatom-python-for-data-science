### Project Overview

 This project consists of file operations in functions.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt a lot about the execution of commands and their syntax from this project.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Additional reading on the syntax of the commands helped me to solve most of the problems.


### Challenges faced

 Even though Python is very popular, it was still difficult to come across many of the operations used in the project. Additional reading helped in creating many of the functions and operations used in the project.
